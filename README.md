This project aims to develop an AI-powered rover equipped with a robotic arm, seamlessly integrated with an Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) display system.

This innovative solution will enable users to remotely control and interact with the rover in complex or hazardous environments, offering enhanced perception and manipulation capabilities.

AI-driven Navigation: The rover will utilize advanced AI algorithms for autonomous navigation, object recognition, and path planning. This will allow it to traverse diverse terrains and adapt to dynamic surroundings with minimal human intervention.

Dexterous Robotic Arm: The integrated robotic arm will provide the rover with versatile manipulation capabilities. It will be capable of grasping, lifting, and manipulating objects of varying shapes and sizes, enabling the rover to perform a wide range of tasks.

Immersive AR/VR Interface: The AR/VR display system will provide users with an immersive and intuitive interface for controlling the rover and its robotic arm. Users will be able to visualize the rover's surroundings in 3D, receive real-time feedback from sensors, and manipulate the arm with natural gestures.

Enhanced Perception: The system will incorporate advanced sensors, such as cameras and depth sensors, to capture rich environmental data. This data will be processed by the AI algorithms to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the rover's surroundings.

Remote Operation: The rover can be controlled remotely from a safe distance, making it ideal for use in hazardous or inaccessible environments. This capability will be crucial for applications such as disaster response, industrial inspection.

Disaster Response: The rover can be deployed in disaster zones to assess damage, search for survivors, and clear debris.

Industrial Inspection: The rover can be used to inspect pipelines, bridges, and other infrastructure in hazardous or hard-to-reach locations.

 Search and Rescue: The rover can be used to search for missing persons in remote or dangerous areas.
